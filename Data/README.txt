Where possible, we collected total mortality from influenza, and converted into mortality rates per million using available population figures.
Occasionally, when only mortality rates were available, we compute total mortality using the available rate and population figures.
In these cases, total mortality numbers may take on fractional values. However, we only provide total mortality numbers for reference,
and our main object of interest are mortality rates, this does not affect the analysis, but users interested in using the data for their
own analysis are encouraged to be cautious in these cases.
Population density refers to persons/acre. Influenza in the ""data"" sheets refers to mortality per million."
